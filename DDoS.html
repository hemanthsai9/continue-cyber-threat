            <p>A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a type of cyberattack where a large number of compromised computers, devices, or systems are used to flood a target (usually a website or server) with excessive traffic or requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. The goal is to overwhelm the target’s resources (such as bandwidth, memory, or processing power), causing a denial of servic</p>

        <h1>Distributed Nature:</h1>
        <p>Unlike traditional DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, which come from a single source, DDoS attacks come from many different sources, often making them harder to defend against. These sources can be computers, devices, or servers that have been compromised and are part of a botnet (a network of infected devices).</p>
        <h1>Types of DDoS Attacks: DDoS attacks can be categorized based on their method of attack. The three most common types are:</h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Desktop/ddos2.jpeg">
        
        <p>Volumetric Attacks: These aim to flood the target with massive amounts of traffic to consume all available bandwidth. For example:
            UDP Floods: Attackers send large volumes of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, causing the target to become overloaded.
            ICMP Floods (Ping Floods): Attackers send excessive ping requests to overwhelm the network.
            Protocol Attacks: These focus on exploiting weaknesses in network protocols to exhaust system resources. Examples include:
            SYN Flood: Attackers send TCP connection requests without completing the handshake, causing the target to maintain half-open connections that consume resources.
            Smurf Attack: Attackers send ICMP echo requests to a network’s broadcast address, causing all devices on the network to respond to a target.
            Application Layer Attacks: These target specific applications or services on the target server, often aiming to overwhelm them with legitimate-looking requests. For example:
            HTTP Flood: Attackers send HTTP requests that appear normal, but in high volume, to overwhelm web servers.
            DNS Query Flood: Overloading DNS servers with requests.</p>
            <h1>Botnets:</h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Documents/ddos7.jpeg" >
            <p>A botnet is a network of compromised devices (e.g., computers, IoT devices) that an attacker controls. These devices are infected with malware, turning them into "bots" that can be remotely directed to launch DDoS attacks. Because botnets use many different sources to carry out the attack, it becomes very hard to block or trace the attack.</p>
            <h1>Targeting: </h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Documents/ddos4.jpeg" width="50%" height="50%">
            <p>Websites: The most common target is a website or web application, which can be made temporarily or permanently unavailable to users.
                Networks: The attack may target the network infrastructure, overwhelming routers, switches, or other network devices.
                Servers: Attackers may target a particular server to deny access to legitimate users, which can affect business operations.</p>
                <h1>DDoS Attack Motives:</h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Documents/ddos5.jpeg">
                <p>Extortion: Attackers might launch a DDoS attack and demand payment (often in cryptocurrency) to stop the attack. This is a form of "ransom DDoS" or RDoS.
                    Protest: Hacktivists might use DDoS attacks as a form of protest against a company or government they disagree with.
                    Competitor Sabotage: Some attackers target competitors to disrupt their operations and gain a business advantage.
                    Disruption: The general aim might be to simply disrupt operations, especially in cases where the attacker has no specific target other than to create chaos.</p>
                    <h1>Mitigating DDoS Attacks:</h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Documents/ddos6.jpeg"width ="50%" height="50%">
                    <p>There are several strategies and tools for defending against DDoS attacks, though perfect defense is challenging due to the sheer scale of some attacks:

                        Traffic Filtering: Use firewalls, routers, or DDoS mitigation services to detect and filter out malicious traffic before it reaches critical infrastructure.
                        
                        Rate Limiting: Implement measures to limit the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a given time period. This can help mitigate application layer attacks.
                        
                        Geo-blocking: If the attack is coming from specific geographic regions, geo-blocking or IP filtering can be used to block traffic from those areas.
                        
                        Load Balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to reduce the load on a single point of failure.
                        
                        Cloud-based DDoS Protection Services: Companies can use specialized DDoS protection services from providers like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or Akamai. These services have vast, distributed networks that can absorb large-scale DDoS attacks.
                        
                        Redundancy: Use redundant systems (such as backup servers and data centers) so that if one part of the network is taken down, services can continue to run from other locations.
                        
                        Anti-DDoS Hardware and Software Solutions: There are dedicated anti-DDoS appliances and software that can monitor traffic patterns, identify malicious traffic, and mitigate attacks in real-time.</p>
                        <h1>DDoS Attack Example:</h1><img src="C:/Users/Heman/OneDrive/Documents/ddos8.jpeg">
                        <p>One of the most famous DDoS attacks was the Dyn attack in 2016, where a botnet made up of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as cameras, DVRs, and routers) launched a massive attack against the Dyn DNS service. The attack disrupted access to major websites, including Twitter, Reddit, and Spotify, for hours.</p>
